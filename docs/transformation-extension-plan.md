# Transformation Extension Plan: Router and Pipeline Engines

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to extend the JSON Schema Registry's transformation capabilities beyond simple JSLT transformations. The current architecture supports basic JSLT-based transformations but lacks support for complex, conditional, or chained transformations. This extension introduces two new transformation engines: **Router Engine** and **Pipeline Engine**.

## Current Architecture Limitations

### Problems with Current Approach
- **Single Transformation per Request**: Each transformation request executes exactly one JSLT transformation
- **No Conditional Logic**: Cannot route transformations based on input data characteristics
- **No Chaining**: Cannot apply multiple transformations sequentially
- **Limited Complexity**: Complex business logic requires convoluted JSLT expressions
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Large JSLT templates become difficult to maintain and debug
- **Security Concerns**: Complex JSLT could potentially be abused for unintended operations

### Current Transformation Flow
```
Input JSON → JSLT Template → Output JSON
```

## Proposed Solution

### New Transformation Engines

#### 1. Router Engine
The Router Engine enables intelligent routing of transformations based on input data characteristics and conditions.

**Key Features:**
- Conditional routing based on JSON path expressions
- Multiple transformation paths for different data types
- Fallback transformations for unmatched conditions
- Configuration-driven routing rules

**Router Flow:**
```
Input JSON → Condition Evaluation → Route Selection → Transformation → Output JSON
```

#### 2. Pipeline Engine
The Pipeline Engine supports sequential application of multiple transformations.

**Key Features:**
- Chained transformation steps
- Intermediate result validation
- Error handling and rollback capabilities
- Configurable pipeline steps

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
Input JSON → Step 1 → Step 2 → ... → Step N → Output JSON
```

### Combined Usage
Router and Pipeline engines can be combined for complex scenarios:
```
Input JSON → Router (selects pipeline) → Pipeline (applies sequence) → Output JSON
```

## Detailed Design

### Router Engine Design

#### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "type": "router",
  "routes": [
    {
      "condition": "$.type == 'user'",
      "transformationId": "user-normalization-v1",
      "description": "Normalize user data"
    },
    {
      "condition": "$.type == 'product' && $.category == 'electronics'",
      "transformationId": "electronics-enrichment-v2",
      "description": "Enrich electronics product data"
    }
  ],
  "defaultTransformationId": "generic-transformation-v1",
  "validation": {
    "inputSchema": "canonical-user-schema-v1",
    "outputSchema": "normalized-user-schema-v1"
  }
}
```

#### Implementation Components
- **ConditionEvaluator**: Evaluates JSON path conditions against input data
- **RouteSelector**: Selects appropriate transformation based on conditions
- **RouterTransformationEngine**: Main engine coordinating routing logic
- **RouteConfiguration**: Manages route definitions and validation

### Pipeline Engine Design

#### Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "type": "pipeline",
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "validate-input",
      "transformationId": "input-validation-v1",
      "continueOnError": false,
      "description": "Validate input data structure"
    },
    {
      "name": "normalize-data",
      "transformationId": "data-normalization-v1",
      "continueOnError": true,
      "description": "Normalize data format"
    },
    {
      "name": "enrich-data",
      "transformationId": "data-enrichment-v2",
      "continueOnError": false,
      "description": "Add computed fields"
    }
  ],
  "validation": {
    "intermediateSchemas": {
      "after-step-1": "validated-schema-v1",
      "after-step-2": "normalized-schema-v1"
    },
    "finalSchema": "enriched-schema-v1"
  }
}
```

#### Implementation Components
- **PipelineStep**: Represents individual transformation step
- **PipelineExecutor**: Manages step execution and error handling
- **PipelineTransformationEngine**: Main engine coordinating pipeline logic
- **IntermediateValidator**: Validates results between pipeline steps

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine Implementation
1. Create `RouterTransformationEngine` class
2. Create `PipelineTransformationEngine` class
3. Implement configuration parsing and validation
4. Add engine registration to `TransformationService`

### Phase 2: Service Integration
1. Update `TransformationService.applyTransformation()` to detect engine type
2. Add configuration validation endpoints
3. Implement engine-specific error handling
4. Add metrics and monitoring

### Phase 3: API Extensions
1. Extend transformation registration API to accept router/pipeline configs
2. Add engine type validation
3. Update transformation listing to include engine metadata
4. Add configuration preview endpoints

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Unit tests for each engine
2. Integration tests for complex scenarios
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Configuration validation testing

## Security Considerations

### Router Engine Security
- JSON path expressions are evaluated in a sandboxed environment
- No arbitrary code execution
- Input validation prevents path traversal attacks
- Configuration validation ensures safe routing rules

### Pipeline Engine Security
- Each step is isolated transformation execution
- Intermediate results are validated against schemas
- Error handling prevents information leakage
- Resource limits prevent excessive processing

## Migration Strategy
